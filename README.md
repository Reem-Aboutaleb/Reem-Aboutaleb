## 💡 About Me

Hi there! I’m Reem — a biomedical engineer and biologist with a heart for clinical impact and a mind built for analytics. I thrive at the intersection of **medicine**, **data**, and **signal processing**, where insights from biology meet the power of Python.

Whether I’m decoding stress from biosignals, modeling drug release, or exploring brainwaves with EEG — I’m always chasing ways to bring **clarity to complexity** and deliver **real-world solutions** that improve lives.

> _“I believe data can be as healing as medicine — if we know how to listen to it.”_
